/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in board creation

  1. Remove all problematic policies and triggers
  2. Create a safe board creation function that bypasses RLS
  3. Implement simple, non-recursive RLS policies
  4. Update the frontend to use the safe function

  This migration completely eliminates the infinite recursion issue by:
  - Using SECURITY DEFINER functions that bypass RLS during critical operations
  - Creating simple policies that don't reference each other
  - Avoiding circular dependencies between boards and board_members tables
